                Hi, I'm JÃºlia, a <mark>FullStack developer</mark>!
            </h1>
            <p>
                I have over 5 years of specialization in building robust
                interfaces using React and Typescript. My professional journey
                extends beyond Frontend development into Backend and Data
                Science. I am currently doing a postgraduate degree in Data
                Science at USP with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. I really
                enjoy challenges within this tech stack, Clean Code, teamwork,
                and continuous learning. In addition to that, I have contributed
                to the Data Science community through the publication of papers,
                with a focus on game mining and climate change prediction.
